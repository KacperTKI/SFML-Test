# SFML-Test
SFML-Assignment-1 From The Dave Churchill YouTube Channel

# What is this about?
Basically, the assignment was to create a SFML application, which can read in a config file and create rectangle and circle shapes with information from that file. These shapes have to bounce off the wall of the window and have their name centered in their shape.

# Why did I do it?
I did it, to familiarize myself with SFML and test the waters. I also wanted to try file I/O in C++. I also played a bit with the smart pointers in C++.
